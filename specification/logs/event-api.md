## Overview

Wikipediaâ€™s [definition of log file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_file):

>In computing, a log file is a file that records either events that occur in an
>operating system or other software runs.

From OpenTelemetry's perspective LogRecords and Events are both represented
using the same [data model](./data-model.md).

However, OpenTelemetry does recognize a subtle semantic difference between
LogRecords and Events: Events are LogRecords which have a `name` and `domain`.
Within a particular `domain`, the `name` uniquely defines a particular class or
type of event. Events with the same `domain` / `name` follow the same schema
which assists in analysis in observability platforms. Events are described in
more detail in the [semantic conventions](./semantic_conventions/events.md).

While the logging space has a diverse legacy with many existing logging
libraries in different languages, there is not ubiquitous alignment with
OpenTelemetry events. In some logging libraries, producing records shaped as
OpenTelemetry events is clunky or error-prone.

The Event API offers convenience methods
for [emitting LogRecords](./bridge-api.md#emit-a-logrecord) that conform
to the [semantic conventions for Events](./semantic_conventions/events.md).
Unlike the [Logs Bridge API](./bridge-api.md), application developers and
instrumentation authors are encouraged to call this API directly.

## EventLogger

The `EventLogger` is the entrypoint of the Event API, and is responsible for
emitting `Events` as `LogRecord`s.

### EventLogger Operations

The `EventLogger` MUST provide functions to:

#### Create EventLogger

New `EventLogger` instances are created though a constructor or factory method
on `EventLogger`.

**Parameters:**

* `logger` - the delegate [Logger](./bridge-api.md#logger) used to emit `Events`
  as `LogRecord`s.
* `event_domain` - the domain of emitted events, used to set the `event.domain`
  attribute.

#### Emit Event

Emit a `LogRecord` representing an `Event` to the delegate `Logger`.

This function MAY be named `logEvent`.

**Parameters:**

* `event_name` - the Event name. This argument MUST be recorded as a `LogRecord`
  attribute with the key `event.name`. Care MUST be taken by the implementation
  to not override or delete this attribute while the Event is emitted to
  preserve its identity.
* `event_data` - this argument should of type [`Attributes`](../common/README.md#attribute)
  and MUST only contain the values as defined by the defined domain-specific schema
  for the `event` (identified by the event domain + name combination) and is
  recorded as a `LogRecod` attribute with the key `event.data`. It is optional to
  support simple ping style events which do not require any form of payload, when
  a payload is required `events` SHOULD provide a `event_data` and not simply use
  `other_attributes` as a replacement.
* `other_attributes` - this argument is used to provide additional context about
  an `event`, it should of type [`Attributes`](../common/README.md#attribute)
  and MUST be recorded as attributes on the `LogRecod`. Care MUST be taken by the
  implementation to not override already recorded attributes with names
  `event.name`, `event.domain` and `event.data`.

**Implementation Requirements:**

The implementation MUST [emit](./bridge-api.md#emit-a-logrecord) the [`LogRecord`](./data-model.md#log-and-event-record-definition)
to the `logger` specified when [creating the EventLogger](#create-eventlogger)
after making the following changes:

* The `event_domain` specified
  when [creating the EventLogger](#create-eventlogger) MUST be set as
  the `event.domain` attribute on the `logRecord`.
* The `event_name` MUST be set as the `event.name` attribute on the `logRecord`.
* The `event_data` if provided MUST be set as the `event.data` attribute on the
 `logRecord`. Validation of the domain-specific contents of the `event_data` is
  optional and not required at the API level, as validation SHOULD occur downstream
  of the API.
* `other_attributes` should be optional and is only provided to enable additional
  context about an `event` it is NOT a replacement for payload of an event which
  is represented by the contents of `event.data`.
